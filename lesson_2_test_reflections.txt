What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
answer: it creates a .git folder to store the meta data. we have to initialize because then only git will create the hidden folder to store the 		older versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
answer: instead of commiting unnecessarily it gives us flexibility to reset back and forth before we make a final commit.
		it offers a lot of flexibility.
